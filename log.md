# Lagrangian Mechanics Project

Radial and spherical symmetries are often exploited in physics to simplify models of systems. These symmetries may appear as spatially varying potentials. The mechanics of a particle confined within a closed surface is also a recurring topic in physics. I am interested in exploring confined motion, oscillatory patterns in space, and physical laws applied to higher-dimensional systems that exhibit n-spherical symmetry; however, the mathematics of systems that encompass all of these characteristics becomes burdensome when taking a Newtonian approach. Lagrangian mechanics greatly simplifies the unpacking and analysis of these systems.

I intend to use Lagrangian mechanics to explore the trajectories and equations of motion of a point particle of mass m moving inside an n-dimensional shell whose radius varies sinusoidally. I will pay particular attention to the cases in which n = 2, 3, and 4 but also attempt to lay out a method for a general case with arbitrary integral n > 1. The sinusoidal variations in the radius will take the form of Fourier series, i.e., the sums of sines.

I determined equations for kinetic energy in two, three, and four dimensions and derived equations of motion for a simple 2D case. I also installed Mathematica on my Ubuntu machine.
